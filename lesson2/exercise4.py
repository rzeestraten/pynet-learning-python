Read in the "show_ip_int_brief.txt" file into your program using the .readlines() method.

Obtain the list entry associated with the FastEthernet4 interface. You can just hard-code the index at this point since we haven't covered for-loops or regular expressions. Use the string .split() method to obtain both the IP address and the corresponding interface associated with the IP.

Create a two element tuple from the result (intf_name, ip_address).

Print that tuple to the screen.

Use pycodestyle on this script. Get the warnings/errors to zero. You might need to 'pip install pycodestyle' on your computer (you should be able to type this from the shell prompt). Alternatively, you can type 'python -m pip install pycodestyle'.
